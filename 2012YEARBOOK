SHORT BIO ABOUT THE SELF :-)

Lei, as her friends call her, is regarded as tall and jolly in her batch who also loves to hang out with her friends, 
likes to stay on the phone for hours and loves to eat a lot. She's a thoughtful young lady who never forgets her duties 
as a daughter, sister and friend. Even though she isn't the prettiest, she's still confident in all the things she does. 
And whenever she fails in any situation, she never gives up and finds a way to fix it and get back again. She never 
leaves you alone in the corner and makes sure every moment with her is worth-remembering. 
She's a true friend and you'll thank God a million times for her existence in your life. 
That's Lei!
